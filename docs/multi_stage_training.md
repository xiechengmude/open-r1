# Multi-Stage Training Process

DeepSeek-R1's exceptional performance is achieved through a carefully designed multi-stage training process. This document outlines each stage and provides implementation guidance.

## Overview

The training process consists of four main stages:
1. Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT)
2. Reasoning-focused RL
3. Rejection Sampling and SFT
4. Utility-focused RL

## Stage 1: Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT)

### Purpose
- Establish baseline reasoning capabilities
- Improve output coherence and readability
- Create a stable foundation for RL

### Implementation
```python
# Example SFT configuration
sft_config = {
    "model_name": "deepseek-base",
    "dataset": "cot_dataset",
    "max_seq_length": 10000,
    "learning_rate": 2e-5,
}
```

### Key Components
1. High-quality Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data
2. Long-context training (up to 10k tokens)
3. Focus on readability and coherence

## Stage 2: Reasoning-focused RL

### Purpose
- Enhance mathematical and coding abilities
- Improve structured problem-solving
- Establish consistent reasoning patterns

### Implementation
```python
# Example reward functions
reward_funcs = {
    "accuracy": check_solution_accuracy,
    "format": verify_reasoning_format,
    "language_consistency": check_language_style
}
```

### Key Components
1. Rule-based rewards for accuracy
2. Format enforcement for clarity
3. Language consistency rewards

## Stage 3: Rejection Sampling and SFT

### Purpose
- Expand model capabilities
- Balance specialized and general tasks
- Maintain reasoning abilities

### Data Generation Process
1. Generate 600k reasoning-focused samples
2. Create 200k general-purpose samples
3. Filter and quality control

### Implementation
```python
# Example rejection sampling configuration
rs_config = {
    "temperature": 0.7,
    "top_p": 0.9,
    "num_samples": 5,
    "acceptance_threshold": 0.8
}
```

## Stage 4: Utility-focused RL

### Purpose
- Enhance practical usability
- Ensure safety and reliability
- Balance performance across tasks

### Reward Components
1. Rule-based reasoning rewards
2. Outcome-based utility rewards
3. Safety and alignment metrics

### Implementation
```python
# Example combined reward structure
def compute_final_reward(completion):
    return (
        0.4 * reasoning_reward(completion) +
        0.3 * utility_reward(completion) +
        0.3 * safety_reward(completion)
    )
```

## Best Practices

1. **Data Quality**
   - Carefully curate training data
   - Implement robust filtering
   - Maintain diverse task coverage

2. **Training Stability**
   - Monitor performance metrics
   - Implement early stopping
   - Use gradient clipping

3. **Evaluation**
   - Regular benchmark testing
   - Cross-task performance checks
   - Safety and alignment validation

## Pipeline Integration

```bash
# Example training pipeline
make sft-train  # Stage 1
make rl-train-reasoning  # Stage 2
make generate-synthetic  # Stage 3 data generation
make sft-train-expanded  # Stage 3 training
make rl-train-utility  # Stage 4
```

## Monitoring and Evaluation

Key metrics to track during training:
1. Task-specific accuracy
2. Output coherence scores
3. Safety compliance rates
4. Cross-task performance
5. Training stability metrics
